<button id="btn2">Hello, My name is Kur Achan A software developer student at AkiraChix, which has been a great journey so far. 
I am working on a project that will enable farmers to save digitally through the local savings Association. In the last six months, I have acquired the technical skills of a full-stack developer that have enabled me to get insights about how the product will look  . Also, I have acquired problem-solving skills which have enabled me to debug errors.

Furthermore, I   collaborated with a team of talented members,  and we created a dashboard for displaying farmer statistics of how they have been performing with the app. I am determined to bring a positive impact to the team and am open to learning as a junior engineer. For non-academic. I was once a student representative at AkiraChix.
The background I have in the software development field has enabled me to be all-rounded I am excited about the opportunities ahead to bring impactful changes to your company.
